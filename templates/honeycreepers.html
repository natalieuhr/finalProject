    Hawaiian honeycreppers are birds endemic to the Hawaiian archapeligo. The Hawaiian honeycreepers were estimated to have arrived 7.2 million years ago, dating back to the Northwest (Leeward) Islands prior to the formation of the island of Kauai 5.1 million years ago. The Hawaiian honeycreepers are believed, with some degree of uncertainty, to have originated in Asia with the Eurasian rosefinches, Carpodacus, being its closest relative (Lerner et al, 2011).  The uncertainty in the genetic tree spurs from the fact that Hawaiian honeycreepers have undergone such rapid speciation yet have low levels of sequence divergence. However, using next-generation DNA sequencing, most of the speciation of the Hawaiian honeycreepers is estimated to have occurred 5.8 to 2.4 million years ago when the islands of Kauai, Niihau, and Oahu were being formed.  As each island was formed and became inhabitable, it was a new opportunity for niche expansion on the uninhabited islands and thus adaptive radiation.

    The overall rate of evolution in the Hawaiian honeycreepers is approximately 0.00035- 0.058 substitutions per site per million years on mitochondrial third codon positions (Lerner et al, 2011). An equivalent measure has not been conducted for the silversword alliance. However, comparing these values would provide insight on how the rate of speciation differs between the flora and fauna in the Hawaiian Islands.

    The Hawaiian honeycreepers diversified into over 50 different species each of which occupying a slightly different niche.  Each species of honeycreeper is different in terms of size, coloring, song, and most notably, their beaks (James, 2004). Since many ecological niches were open as the Hawaiian Islands were being formed, The Principle of Competitive Exclusion did not apply since there were no species occupying the other niches. Thus, honeycreepers began finding food in different ways and thus different populations underwent natural selection that favored the beak type that best suited their dietary habits.  Hawaiian honeycreepers’ can now be group into five different categories based off of their diet and subsequent beak design: nectarivores, generalists, foragers among leaves, bark pickers, and seed and fruit eaters (Losos and Ricklefs, 2009). Phenotypic differences like coloring, songs, and beak shape likely have increased the rate of speciation through sexual selection.

    Since humans arrived in the Hawaiian Islands, the honeycreepers have been threatened from destruction of habitat, introduction of pray and niche competitors, as well as avian diseases. Additionally, global warming amplifies the rate at which disease spreads further worsening the problem. Today, 17 of the 50+ species of honeycreepers remain with 14 of them being listed as endangered species (Atkinson and Lapointe, 2009).  Help scientist by using this website’s catalog to help identify which species of bird to locate and submitting the form to track locations and relative population levels of the Hawaiian honeycreepers.
