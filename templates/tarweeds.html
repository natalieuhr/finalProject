    The Hawaiian Silversword Alliance is estimated to have arrived in Hawaii 5.2 million years ago during the time the island of Kauai was being formed (Baldwin and Sanderson, 1998). Through research using cpDNA (chloroplast DNA) evidence, the origin of the Hawaiian Silversword Alliance can be traced back to California.  Presently, the Hawaiian Silversword Alliance (Argyroxiphium, Diubautia, and Wilkesia) is most similar to the tarweeds Madia bolanderi and Raillardiopsis muirii in California (Baldwin, Kyhos, & Dvorak, 1990). The biological dispersal from North America is astonishing because of the Hawaii’s geographical isolation of 3,900 km coupled with the fact that the tarweeds likely relied on a bird to facilitate this move. Additionally, tarweeds inhabiting the Hawaiian Islands was unlikely as tarweeds are self-incompatible. Self-incompatibility prevents inbreeding as reproduction can only occur between individuals with different S-alleles. Thus, much like the Hawaiian honeycreepers and other animal species, at least two individuals had to have been brought to the Hawaiian Islands in order to allow for the adaptive radiation to start (Baldwin et al, 1990).  <br><br>

    The diversification rate, the rate of which new species form and existing species go extinct, is approximately 0.56 species per million of years. An equivalent measure has not been conducted for the Hawaiian honeycreepers. However, for comparison, in 7.2 million years honeycreepers have diversified into 50+ species with 30+ having gone extinct (Lerner et al, 2011).

    Today, 28 species of the Hawaiian Silversword Alliance occupy six Hawaiian Islands in wet, dry, alpine and forest environments (Carlquist, Baldwin, & Carr, 2003).  They range in vegetative form from trees to shrubs to vines (Baldwin and Sanderson, 1998).  Much like the Hawaiian honeycreepers, the silversword did not face competition, in a plant’s case for soil, or predation. Additionally, flora’s version of sexual selection are changes in pollination vectors or flowering time which causes allopatric speciation (Abbott, Ritchie, & Hollingsworth, 2008).

    Like honeycreepers, diversity is highest on the oldest islands and generally decreases as each island’s age decreases, with Oahu and the Big Island of Hawaii as anomalies possibly due to humans. Unlike the honeycreepers, only one species of the Hawaiian Silversword Alliance has gone extinct, however, some others are endangered.
